While the current implementation of "Health-chain" is not handling gas or eth, I have very few security measures. I would discuss a couple here that I would have considered if and when "Health-chain" was to be implemented as a production system.

Re-entrancy Attacks:

Make sure the handling of gas and cost of transactions are settled prior to calling external contracts. This would prevent the draining of "funds" when rogue contracts manipulating the gas calculation were used as the system gets dragged into a recursive loop.

Denial of Services:

Attackers could discover the reversion conditions established by the vulerable smart contract. Rogue contracts can be used to perpetually cause cause the reversion by breaking the threshold of these requirements. Set up eth and/or looping limit to prevent the system from overtaken by DoS attackers.
